This repository contains the solution for GoIT Markup Homework #4.

This assignment focuses on advanced CSS techniques for production-ready frontend development, specifically:

üõ†Ô∏è Key Technical Features
Vector Graphics: Implementation of all icons using SVG Sprites.

The sprite was generated with IcoMoon and optimized using SVGOMG.

Backgrounds: Using a multi-layer background with a linear gradient to achieve the required darkening effect on the hero section image.

CSS Transitions: Implementing smooth hover and focus effects using CSS transitions.

Transitions are configured with a duration of 250ms and the cubic‚àíbezier(0.4,0,0.2,1) timing function.

Only explicitly specified properties are animated (no all value used).

Advanced Styling:

Creating a decorative underline for the current page link using the ::after pseudo-element.

Implementing a sliding text overlay on portfolio cards that appears on hover.
